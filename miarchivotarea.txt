A two-inch layer of freshly fallen snow covered the yard. Stacey peeked 
outside. To most, it would have been a beautiful sight worthy of taking

he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go 
back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. That 
curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone.
